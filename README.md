First project with the new curriculum on The Odin Project. A recipes site. It'll look like poop. That's ok. No CSS I believe in here. Just a bunch of lined code.

Ok. It's done. It took me a bit longer than I thought it would but most of that is because I was trying to be funny with my recipes. They're stupid. But I think the spirit of the course is in there. Nothing is really formatted with CSS so it looks a bit basic...but like I said, I think that's what we're going for here.
