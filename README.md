First project with the new curriculum on The Odin Project. A recipes site. It'll look like poop. That's ok. No CSS I believe in here. Just a bunch of lined code.

Ok. It's done. It took me a bit longer than I thought it would but most of that is because I was trying to be funny with my recipes. They're stupid. But I think the spirit of the course is in there. Nothing is really formatted with CSS so it looks a bit basic...but like I said, I think that's what we're going for here.

    I know that a README probably shouldn't be a journal but I'm going to use it as one anyway. After the six CSS exercises I'm supposed to pimp out the recipes site that we made prior to learning CSS. So that's what I'm going to do. Heeeeeere comes DIVs.
