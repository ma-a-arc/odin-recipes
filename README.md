First project with the new curriculum on The Odin Project. A recipes site. It'll look like poop. That's ok. No CSS I believe in here. Just a bunch of lined code.

Ok. It's done. It took me a bit longer than I thought it would but most of that is because I was trying to be funny with my recipes. They're stupid. But I think the spirit of the course is in there. Nothing is really formatted with CSS so it looks a bit basic...but like I said, I think that's what we're going for here.

    I know that a README probably shouldn't be a journal but I'm going to use it as one anyway. After the six CSS exercises I'm supposed to pimp out the recipes site that we made prior to learning CSS. So that's what I'm going to do. Heeeeeere comes DIVs.

    I was up at four doing this. I'm done styling the index page and am moving onto the css for the actual recipe pages. It's going well. I gotta make lunches for work now though so I guess that's it for this morning. I'll be revisiting this at night maybe. I hope I'm using GitHub properly. I push origin main every time I shut my laptop's screen. Maybe I'm just supposed to commit changes and push when it's ALL done? I don't know. I'll keep doing it my way until someone tells me I'm doing it wrong.

    Time for another foray into this course!
